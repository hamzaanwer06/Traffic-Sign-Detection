# Real-Time-Traffic-Sign-Detection
I have trained SSDlite-MobilenetV2 Model on GTSDB. I was able to achieve 75% mAP on testing dataset of GTSDB. It took me 22768 steps to train the model. Afterwards my validation accuracy started to decrease.  
The reason why i selected SSDlite because we made use of researchers work which shows that ssd-mobilnet is the fastest and lightest model in terms of memory consumption.Further details can be found in this link. https://github.com/aarcosg/traffic-sign-detection  
In the link above, they have discussed about ssd model instead of ssdlite. SSDlite is slightly better in terms of FPS on embedded device.  
I also trained ssd-mobilenetv2 with ssdlite-mobilenetv2. After training both models,i have concluded that both have same mAP on testing dataset .While during implementation on raspberry pi 4 , we had 30% more FPS using ssdlite.  
Here are the steps i did in order to train a model:    
1. First of all i downloaded the GTSDB dataset from this link https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/ff17dc924eba88d5d01a807357d6614c/published-archive.html  
2. The dataset is in PPM format so i converted them to png format through the code i provided in (ppm to png.py) above in files section.  
3. Then i created tensorflow record(tfrecord) file.Generate_tfrecord.py is also provided above in order to convert images and csv file into tfrecord. You can take help from the link https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10  
4. After creating tfrecord file, i migrated to Google Colab since i didn't had access to heavy GPU and CPU.  
5. I used premium account in order to train the model.It took me 6-8 hours straight to train the model using p100 gpu.  
6. I have also provided model's config file in Model folder. You can download the model using this link https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md  
7. I have attached the labelmap.pbtxt file which was used in order to train model on GTSDB.  
8. I trained the model twice.First time with training dataset(containing 600 images) and validation dataset(300 images which is originally for testing ).Once i got the approximate number of steps around which my model trained for the first time. On second run , i trained the model straight to that number of steps that is 22768.(The reason i didn't train the model in single run only because i had limited 900 pictures only in which 600 for training and 300 for testing. I didn't want to further split training dataset into (training and validation dataset).  
9. i have attached a picture in results folder of mAP calculated during first training run with name mAP1 ![Screenshot](mAP1.png) and for second training picture is named as mAP2 available in results folder.  
10. I have also attaced PR(precision recall) curves of it in the results folder.One PR curve out of three is shown here.It is for prohibitory sign.![Screenshot](PR_prohibitory.png)  
Testing samples are also attached in result folder.Two of the testing images are shown below. ![Screenshot](test_image7.png)

11. Inference graph of my model can be downloaded from the link. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CEd_Grc3Vqmlmko0U6ggWEAtGspkwxrA/view?usp=sharing  
12. Then i implemented this model on raspberry pi 4. I got FPS from (1.6 - 2.1) FPS.  
13. I also added audio assist system to it. The model says the name of the class of traffic sign it detected.
